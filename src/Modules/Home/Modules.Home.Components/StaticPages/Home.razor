			<ul class="tw-list-disc tw-ml-6 tw-space-y-2 tw-marker:tw-text-primary">
				<li><strong>Fadi Labs</strong> is a software project inspired by the principles of modular architecture but built with an opinionated design tailored to my vision.</li>
				<li>It serves as both a platform for improving my programming skills and a personal portfolio.</li>
				<li>The name combines my first name, Fadi, with the concept of "Labs," representing a collection of purpose-driven modules, or "labs," each focused on delivering specific functionality.</li>
				<li>While not strictly modular, each lab in Fadi Labs is designed to be self-contained and cohesive, offering unique features that seamlessly integrate into the overall system.</li>
