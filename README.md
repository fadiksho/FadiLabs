- Fadi Labs is a software project inspired by the principles of modular architecture but built with an opinionated design tailored to my vision.
- It serves as both a platform for improving my programming skills and a personal portfolio.
- The name combines my first name, Fadi, with the concept of "Labs," representing a collection of purpose-driven modules, or "labs," each focused on delivering specific functionality.
- While not strictly modular, each lab in Fadi Labs is designed to be self-contained and cohesive, offering unique features that seamlessly integrate into the overall system.
